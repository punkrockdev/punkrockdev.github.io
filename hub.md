## The space

ŠenoaHub is a 120 m2 shared office in the centre of Zagreb (close to the main train station and the park Tomislavac). It consists of two large rooms we use for work and a smaller meeting room which you can reserve when needed. There's also a kitchen and dining room which you can help yourself to.

## Neighbourhood

As we're located in the very centre of Zagreb, there are lots of restaurants and cafes to choose from during your lunch / coffee break. We occasionally cook 🥘 or order food 🍣 and eat together. Sunbathing at Tomislavac (about 30 seconds away) during your Zoom calls is a must! ☀️😎

As we're close to the main train station and about 10 minutes from the main square, it's very easy to reach ŠenoaHub by tram, train or bicycle (depending on where you are located, maybe even on foot). If you prefer to drive, there's a public garage in [Petrinjska](https://goo.gl/maps/mchr8yQQZPWLyBDb9), which is just around the corner.
