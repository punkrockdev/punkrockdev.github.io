## The space

≈†enoaHub is a 120 m2 shared office in the centre of Zagreb (close to the main train station and the park Tomislavac).
It consists of two large rooms for desk work and a smaller meeting room.

All the office rooms are air conditioned, the space has central heating and has many windows for ample natural light.

There's a fully equipped kitchen and a dining room which you can help yourself to for lunch breaks.

## Neighbourhood

As we're located in the very centre of Zagreb, there are lots of restaurants and cafes to choose from during your lunch / coffee break.
We occasionally cook ü•ò or order food üç£ and eat together. Sunbathing at Tomislavac (about 30 seconds away) during your Zoom calls is a must! üòé

![Tomislavac is just a few steps away](/images/hub/tomislavac.jpg)

As we're close to the main train station and about 10 minutes from the main square, it's very easy to reach ≈†enoaHub by tram, train or bicycle
(depending on where you are located, maybe even on foot). If you prefer to drive, there are three public garages nearby,
the closest one in [Petrinjska](https://goo.gl/maps/mchr8yQQZPWLyBDb9) being just around the corner.

## Renting

We offer flexible daily desk and meeting room packages for occasional usage or more long-term fixed desk rental.

Renting a fixed desk requires a minimum 2 month contract, but includes:

- üñ® printer use
- üó£ free meeting room use
- üå±üñ• space for setting up your desk exactly as you like
- ü•≥ getting to hang out with us more often!

The meeting room includes:

- üì∫ a TV for presentations

Normally, long-term renters bring their own desks, chairs and other equipment,
but we do have a few smaller desks available if you prefer to use them.

Of course, all options include WiFi üì° and coffee ‚òïÔ∏è. Office dogs are very welcome too! üê∂
