## IDEAS, DEVELOPMENT & PUNK ROCK

So, here's the deal … Punk Rock Dev is an **indie web development studio**.
We apply the DIY, no nonsense philosophy of punk rock to efficiently develop
apps from concept to implementation. We believe that lean product development
and smart priorities based on real data are important to build good apps
that people will love.


## DISCOGRAPHY

Rather than spend too much space on words, here are some of our past projects …


## THE BAND

### Dražen Lučanin

Hi! I'm a software developer working in the industry since 2009.
I have experience with both web app backends in **Python** or **Ruby**
and frontends in **JavaScript**. Having done a PhD in computer science,
I know my way around **data analysis**, visualisation
and algorithms from domains like **machine learning** too – useful tools
when tackling challenging problems.
I started Punk Rock Dev to create practical apps that help people,
while working in a fun & relaxed atmosphere.

On larger projects I work with **a team of skilled developers and designers**
to deliver the best product quickly and efficiently.
