- Why we value your privacy

We value your privacy as much as we do our own, so we’re committed to keeping your personal and business information safe. We’re uncomfortable with the information companies, governments, and other organisations keep on file, so we ask for only the bare minimum from our customers. We’ll never use your personal information for any reason other than why you gave it, and we’ll never give anyone access to it unless we’re forced to by law.

### How we collect information

We ask for contact information including your name and email address on our website so that we can reply to your enquiry.

We use cookies and scripts for basic analytics services, such as Google, Facebook and Twitter Analytics which collect anonymized data of website / social page visitors which help us improve our marketing efforts.

We collect your name and email address when you sign up for one of our newsletters.

We ask for your account and contact information when you hire or buy something from us.

Occasionally, we might receive your contact information from one of our partners. If we do, we protect it in exactly the same way as if you give it to us directly.

### What information we hold

When you contact us by email or through our website, we collect your name, email address if you’ve given us that and any other information you add to your message.
If you sign up for a newsletter, we only collect your name and email address.

When you buy something from us, we collect your name, email address, phone number, and a delivery address.

If you do business with us, we also collect your business name and bank details and keep records of the invoices we send you and the payments you make.

When you contact us by email or through our website, we store your your information in Formspree, our Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software. If you sign up for a newsletter, we store your email address in Mailchimp, which is the marketing platform we prefer. If we do business, we store your information in our accounts software, Harvest. We chose these systems partly for their commitment to security.

### What we use your information for

We occasionally use your contact information to send you details of our products and services. When we do, you have the option to unsubscribe from these communications and we won’t send them to you again. We might also email you about our products and services, but if you tell us not to, we won’t get in touch again. We will use your information to send you invoices, statements, or reminders.

### Who’s responsible for your information at our company

Dražen Lučanin, our founder, is responsible for the security of your information. You can contact them by email at <hello@punkrockdev.com> if you have any concerns about the information we store.

### Who has access to information about you

When we store information in our own systems, only the people who need it have access. Our management team have access to everything you’ve provided, but individual employees have access to only what they need to do their job.

### The steps we take to keep your information private

Where we store your information in third-party services, we restrict access only to people who need it. We store passwords in LastPass, an encrypted password manager, use a different, randomly generated password for each service, and never use the same password twice.

The computers we use all have encrypted hard drives and are protected by a passcode or fingerprint access. These computers ask for authentication whenever they’re started or after 5 minutes of inactivity. Our mobile devices are also protected by a fingerprint or facial recognition.

### How to complain

We take complaints very seriously. If you’ve any reason to complain about the ways we handle your privacy, please contact Dražen Lučanin by email at <hello@punkrockdev.com>. If you’re the letter writing type, send your envelope to our address:

Punk Rock Dev d.o.o.<br/>
Domobranska 19, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia

or

Punk Rock Dev OÜ<br/>
Sepapaja 6, Tallinn 15551, Estonia
